\section{Implementation choices}

\subsection{Contracts}
The first decision was to split the required functionality in two contracts:
the first contract only handles creation and join of games (i.e. deployment and
setup of a game contract), whereas the second contract is used to actually play
the game. This decision was taken for two main reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Code readability and auditability: while it would be possible to implement
	      everything in a single contract, code readability and auditability would suffer
	      from such a choice. Splitting the functionality in multiple contracts allows
	      reasoning about them separately.
	\item Security: as the contract would have to deal with multiple games at once, it
	      would be more likely to introduce hard-to-spot vulnerabilities. For example, it
	      would be possible for the contract to erroneously act on the wrong game. By
	      having each game be played on a different contract, this scenario is avoided.
\end{itemize}
Of course, this also implies a higher cost of a complete game as deploying a
contract is costly in terms of the required Gas.

\subsubsection{Joining a random game}
The contract keeps a list of games that can be joined. When attempting to join
a random game, a starting index is computed pseudo-randomly. In particular, the
starting index is taken as following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First, the keccak256 hash with the hash of the previous block, the address of
	      the caller, and a nonce (which is incremented after each use). Together, this
	      should guarantee that a different hash is always computed.
	\item Then, a modulo operation with the length of list of games is used.
\end{itemize}
This starting index is then used to traverse the list of joinable games.
Iterating on the list is needed to search for a game that was not created by
the caller. Therefore, in most cases, the loop body will only be executed once.

\subsubsection{Board size, encoding and fleet}
The chosen board size is a $8 \times 8$ board.

The board is encoded using a Merkle tree, following the project requirements.
Each cell may contain a ship (encoded as boolean \mintinline{solidity}{true})
or not (\mintinline{solidity}{false}). The content of the cell is hashed
together with a cryptographically strong random salt. Additionally, also the
index in the linearized matrix is hashed. Only the root of the Merkle tree is
sent to the contract, which uses it to validate proofs sent by the client.

This encoding, however, does not allow to easily check some conditions on the
fleet. In particular, given a board and a set of rules about the fleet
composition, the procedure to determine if the board respects the rules is
quite complex, as it requires checking that there exist an interpretation of
the board that satisfies the required properties. The choice in this case was
to relax board checking: as no requirements were set regarding the fleet
composition, the decision was to allow any fleet composition, with the only
requirement that every ship must be withing the board's boundaries, and that
the total number of ``ship cells'' is the fixed one ($10$ on a $8\times 8$
board).

A more efficient encoding using triplets of $\langle coords, size,
	direction\rangle$ could be used to simplify board checking. Given a set of
triplets, it is trivial to verify that they respect a certain fleet
composition, as well as other properties (e.g. no collisions between ships).
However, it is not as trivial to come up with a scheme that allows to verify
that the triplets actually belong to a board.

\subsection{Front-end}
The front-end has been implemented using \href{https://react.dev/}{\color{blue}
	React} and \href{https://reactrouter.com/en/main}{\color{blue} React-router}.
These two libraries allow to quickly design and implement a front-end offering
a good user experience.

The use of React-router also greatly simplifies the code: loaders and actions
are used to load data from the contract, whereas actions allow sending
transactions. Overall, this allows to keep data loading and mutation separated
from data visualization and user interaction.

An important choice during implementation regards the generation of salts for
the Merkle tree. As salts need to be random in order to prevent attacks (more
on this in \cref{sec:potential_vulnerabilities}), cryptographically secure
random numbers need to be used. Fortunately, the
\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto}{\color{blue}Crypto
	API} of modern browsers allow generating cryptographically strong random
numbers easily. For these reasons, the front-end implementation uses this API
in order to generate secure salts which allow preventing many attacks.

To allow seamless reloading of the battleship game webpage, both the board and
the Merkle tree of the player are saved in the indexedDB of the browser (using
\href{https://github.com/localForage/localForage}{\color{blue}localForage}).
Possible attacks exploiting XSS vulnerabilities to steal the board
configuration do not work as React is safe against XSS by
default\footnote{Although this is not true in every case, the potential attack
	vectors for XSS vulnerabilities are very few and easy to avoid in React.}.

For the creation of Merkle trees and related Merkle proofs, the library
\href{https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree}{\color{blue}@openzeppelin/merkle-tree}
was used.
