\section{Gas evaluation}
Gas was evaluated automatically by using Truffle tests. A test file was created
to get and save to file the gas used by each transaction. \Cref{tab:gas_costs}
shows the cost of each function. \Cref{tab:full_game_gas_cost} shows the total
gas used for a $8 \times 8$ board, assuming each player misses all the guesses.

A few notes about gas costs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The cost of the \mintinline{solidity}{attack} function is very similar to that
	      of \mintinline{solidity}{checkAndAttack}, although it does considerably less
	      work. This is likely due to the fact that \mintinline{solidity}{attack}
	      initializes some storage variables, which is more costly the first time.
	\item The cost of the \mintinline{solidity}{checkWinnerBoard} varies greatly based on
	      the number of cells that need to be checked (only cells that have not been shot
	      yet need to be sent to the contract). Multi Merkle proofs with the
	      aforementioned library, however, are more efficient, therefore, generally
	      speaking, a game in which not all shots are missed should cost a little less
	      than shown in \cref{tab:full_game_gas_cost}.
\end{itemize}
